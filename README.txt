*DataSurgeLite has an additional function "Decrypt" and "Encrypt" under Tools
	-Under Decrypt there are 2 options:
					   -Decrypt (decrypts data)
					   -Decrypt and Overwrite (decrypts and overwrites data)

	-Encrypt encrypts all your current data
	-you can decrypt it by using "decrypt" under tools->decrypt
	-or you can decrypt and overwrite it by clicking "decrypt and overwrite" under tools->decrypt
	-when you add/delete/edit an entry, you have to encrypt your data AGAIN
